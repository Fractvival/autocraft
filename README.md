# autocraft

This program will automatically download the Snapshot and Release version of Minecraft (Java Edition) and launch it to play.
The program constantly monitors the update of the version and if it detects a new one, it stops the server, downloads it, and then restarts the server with the new version.
Never miss the latest Minecraft release again!


Do not forget to edit the config.txt file before starting and commissioning
It is also advisable to adjust the server settings in the server.properties file according to your preferences

!! It only works for Windows 10+11 (I haven't tried Windows 7)
